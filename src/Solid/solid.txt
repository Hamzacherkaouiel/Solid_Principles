Single Responsiblity:
    - each class should have only one purpose ,
    and not be filled with excessive functions

Open/Closed:
   - class should be open for extension and closed for modification

Liskov Substitution:
    - if a class A is a subtype of class B , then we should be able to replace
    B with A without disrupting the behaviour of our programme

Interface Segregation:
    - Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do,
    large interfaces should be divided into small ones

Dependency Inversion:
    - Components should depend on abstraction not concretion
